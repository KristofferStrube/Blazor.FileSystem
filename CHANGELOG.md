## [Unreleased]
### Deprecated
- Deprecated synchronous `FileSystemDirectoryHandle.Create`, `FileSystemFileHandle.Create`, `FileSystemHandle.Create`, and `FileSystemWritableFileStream.Create` creator method in favor of asynchronous `CreateAsync` methods.
### Changed
- Changed the version of `Blazor.FileAPI` to use the newest version which is 0.4.0.
- Changed constructors of `FileSystemHandle`, `FileSystemHandleInProcess`, `FileSystemFileHandle`, `FileSystemFileHandleInProcess`, `FileSystemDirectoryHandle`, `FileSystemDirectoryHandleInProcess`, and `FileSystemWritableFileStreamInProcess` to be protected instead of internal so that they can be extended.
- Changed all non-creator methods that return `IJSWrappers` so that their returned objects will dispose their `JSReference` when they are disposed. As an example `File`s returned from `FileSystemFileHandle.GetFileAsync` will now dispose their `JSReference` when the `File` is disposed so that you don't need to manually dispose the `JSReference` before disposing the `File` itself.
### Added
- Added target for .NET 8.
- Added `CreateAsync` creator methods for all wrapper classes that were missing them.
- Added `IAsyncDisposable` implementation to all wrapper classes that ensures that their helpers and `JSReference`s are disposed.

### Added
- Added XML Documentation to all public types and members.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-01-25
